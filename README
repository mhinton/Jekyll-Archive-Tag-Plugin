## Jekyll Archive Tag Plugin ##

In your Jekyll blog directoy create the _plugins directory if it doesn't
already exist. Then in your archive.html template page insert the call for the
tag.

    {% render_archives site  %}

When you rebuild your archives page will have year headings and under
those will be month name and then posts in that month will be listed.

You will need to create styles in your style sheet for these classes.

  archive_year, archive_month, archive_title, archive_day
